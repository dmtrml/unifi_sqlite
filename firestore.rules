/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. The `userId` MUST match the Firebase Authentication UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transactions owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Stores categories created by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}: Stores financial accounts owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/recurringTransactions/{recurringTransactionId}: Stores recurring transactions owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document and the data nested under it.
 * - No public listing of users is allowed.
 * - Read-only access is not supported in this prototype.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - All documents under `/users/{userId}` are expected to have a `userId` field that matches the `{userId}` path segment. This is enforced on creation.
